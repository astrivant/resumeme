    "toolbox-use": (
        "The bars rank tools by the distinct recorded tasks in which they were used. "
        "Only the latest observation of each task contributes, so revising a record does not inflate its count. "

        "This diagram connects specific kinds of engineering problems to their broader categories. "
        "Task counts show where work has been recorded within that structure, linking concrete assignments to recurring problem-solving "

    "checkpoint-transitions": (
        "Each column compares consecutive project visits, showing changes in the lessons and skill applications recorded between them. "
